### Aho-Corasick Algorithm
<p>The [Aho-Corasick algorithm](https://github.com/rfkhan123/portfolio.github.io/blob/main/Algorithm_Implementations/Aho_Corasick.cpp) is an efficient method for searching multiple keywords simultaneously within a text. It builds a finite state machine (FSM) that processes the input text in linear time, making it highly suitable for real-time keyword detection in social media applications.</p>

## Priority Ranking of Feed
<p>Priority ranking in social media refers to the system used to determine the order in which content is displayed to users. This is crucial for enhancing user engagement and ensuring relevant content is shown at the top of feeds. Various algorithms and methods are employed to prioritize content based on multiple factors such as user interactions, content quality, and relevance.</p>

### Head-Based Priority Ranking
<p>[Head-based priority ranking](https://github.com/rfkhan123/portfolio.github.io/blob/main/Algorithm_Implementations/Head_Based_priority.cpp) is a technique where the "head" of the content distribution (i.e., the most popular or high-priority items) is given precedence. This approach leverages the popularity and engagement metrics of content to rank it higher, ensuring that the most significant and relevant posts are seen first by users.</p>

## Search features
<p>Search features in social media apps allow users to find specific content, users, hashtags, and topics quickly and efficiently. These features are essential for enhancing user engagement, enabling users to discover new content, connect with others, and stay updated on topics of interest.</p>

### Tries
<p>[A trie](https://github.com/rfkhan123/portfolio.github.io/blob/main/Algorithm_Implementations/Tries.cpp) is a highly efficient data structure used for fast retrieval of strings, making it ideal for implementing search features in social media apps. Tries can significantly improve the speed and accuracy of search operations, especially for autocomplete and prefix-based search functionalities.</p>

### Inverted Indexes
<p>[Inverted indexes](https://github.com/rfkhan123/portfolio.github.io/blob/main/Algorithm_Implementations/Inverted_Index.cpp) are a powerful data structure used in social media apps to enable efficient full-text search capabilities. They facilitate quick retrieval of documents (e.g., posts, comments, messages) that contain specific keywords or phrases. This is essential for features like search bars, hashtag tracking, content discovery, and more.</p>

## User Connections
<p>User connections in social media apps form the backbone of social interactions, allowing users to connect, follow, friend, or network with one another. These connections are critical for content sharing, communication, and community building within the app. Understanding and managing user connections is key to enhancing user engagement and ensuring a robust social experience.</p>

### BFS
<p>Breadth-First Search is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm used extensively to explore user connections in social media apps. In the context of social media, users can be represented as nodes in a graph, and connections as edges. BFS is particularly useful for tasks that involve exploring the shortest path between users, discovering all connections at a certain degree of separation, and analyzing the structure of user networks.</p>

## Identifying Influencers
<p>Identifying influencers in social media apps is crucial for understanding which users have significant impact and reach within the network. Influencers drive engagement, spread content, and shape trends. To identify these key individuals, algorithms such as PageRank and centrality measures are employed.</p>

### PageRank Algorithms
<p>PageRank is an algorithm initially developed by Google to rank web pages in search engine results. It can also be applied to social media networks to identify influential users. The idea is that the importance of a user is determined by the number and quality of connections they have.</p>

### Centrality Algorithms
<p>Centrality measures help determine the most important nodes (users) in a network. Different centrality metrics provide various insights into user influence.</p>

## Engagement Analysis
<p>Engagement analysis in social media apps involves measuring and understanding how users interact with content, other users, and the platform itself. It plays a crucial role in assessing the effectiveness of content strategies, user retention efforts, and overall platform health. Various engagement metrics are used to quantify user interactions, providing insights that guide decisions on content promotion, user experience enhancements, and community management.</p>

### Engagement Metric Analysis
<p>Engagement metrics encompass a range of quantitative and qualitative measures that gauge user activity and interaction levels. These metrics are analyzed to uncover patterns, trends, and areas for improvement within the social media platform.</p>

## Community Detection
<p>Community detection in social media apps involves identifying groups of users who interact more frequently with each other than with the rest of the network. These communities represent clusters of users with common interests, activities, or relationships. Detecting such communities is crucial for targeted marketing, personalized content delivery, and enhancing user experience by fostering meaningful interactions.</p>
