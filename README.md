### Inverted Indexes
[Inverted indexes](https://github.com/rfkhan123/portfolio.github.io/blob/main/Algorithm_Implementations/Inverted_Index.py)  are a powerful data structure used in social media apps to enable efficient full-text search capabilities. They facilitate quick retrieval of documents (e.g., posts, comments, messages) that contain specific keywords or phrases. This is essential for features like search bars, hashtag tracking, content discovery, and more. 

## 6. User Connections
 User connections in social media apps form the backbone of social interactions, allowing users to connect, follow, friend, or network with one another. These connections are critical for content sharing, communication, and community building within the app. Understanding and managing user connections is key to enhancing user engagement and ensuring a robust social experience. 

### BFS
[Breadth-First Search](https://github.com/rfkhan123/portfolio.github.io/blob/main/Algorithm_Implementations/BFS.cpp)  is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm used extensively to explore user connections in social media apps. In the context of social media, users can be represented as nodes in a graph, and connections as edges. BFS is particularly useful for tasks that involve exploring the shortest path between users, discovering all connections at a certain degree of separation, and analyzing the structure of user networks. 

## 7. Identifying Influencers
 Identifying influencers in social media apps is crucial for understanding which users have significant impact and reach within the network. Influencers drive engagement, spread content, and shape trends. To identify these key individuals, algorithms such as PageRank and centrality measures are employed. 

### PageRank Algorithms
[PageRank](https://github.com/rfkhan123/portfolio.github.io/blob/main/Algorithm_Implementations/PageRank.cpp)   is an algorithm initially developed by Google to rank web pages in search engine results. It can also be applied to social media networks to identify influential users. The idea is that the importance of a user is determined by the number and quality of connections they have. 

### Centrality Algorithms
 Centrality measures help determine the most important nodes (users) in a network. Different centrality metrics provide various insights into user influence. 

## 8. Engagement Analysis
 Engagement analysis in social media apps involves measuring and understanding how users interact with content, other users, and the platform itself. It plays a crucial role in assessing the effectiveness of content strategies, user retention efforts, and overall platform health. Various engagement metrics are used to quantify user interactions, providing insights that guide decisions on content promotion, user experience enhancements, and community management.
